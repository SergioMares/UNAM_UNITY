## Using this package

To make this package available to the Unity package manager, a scoped registry needs to be added to your Unity project.
This can be done by importing the Unity editor script available here: [https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/sdk](https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/sdk)

As an alternative, you can directly add the scoped registry to your project by editing the *manifest.json* in your project’s *Packages* folder, adding an entry for “scopedRegistries”: 

    {
      "scopedRegistries": [ 
        { 
          "name": "Vuforia", 
          "url": " https://registry.packages.developer.vuforia.com/", 
          "scopes": [ 
            "com.ptc.vuforia" 
          ] 
        } 
      ], 
      "dependencies": { 
        ...
      } 
    } 

Once the scoped registry has been added, the latest version of the Vuforia Engine package is available in the Unity Package Manager UI.
